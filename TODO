* Regression:
** Create test cases for any Process in Master/Server/Processes
** Create test cases for any Master/Adapter
** Create test framework for Slave/Listeners
** Create tests for configuration files

* Development:
** Implement in-code TODOs
** Implement Product verification (version...) before installing
** Implement an installation step that checks if the product is genuine before patching it + Regression
** Check WEACEShowMaster/SlaveInfo relevance
** Big code review to remove useless functions
** When WEACE Slave Client does not execute Actions due to uninstalled or unconfigured Adapters, we have to know it.
