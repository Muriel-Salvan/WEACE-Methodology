* Regression:
** Create test framework for Slave/Listeners
** Create tests for configuration files

* Development:
** Implement in-code TODOs
** Implement Product verification (version...) before installing
** Check WEACEShowMaster/SlaveInfo relevance
** Big code review to remove useless functions
** When WEACE Slave Client does not execute Actions due to uninstalled or unconfigured Adapters, we have to know it.
** Check if DBEnv.sh can be removed.
** Check if CmdOtherSession framework can be removed.
** Adapt ShowWEACE{Master|Slave}Info.rb so they display information correctly.
