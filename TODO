* Regression:
** Add Tests for MasterServer matching correct Tools depending on the Config and the Actions returned by the Process. Don't forget to test Tools::All.
** Create test framework for Slave/Listeners
** Create tests for configuration files

* Development:
** Implement in-code TODOs
** Implement Product verification (version...) before installing
** Check WEACEShowMaster/SlaveInfo relevance
** Big code review to remove useless functions
** When WEACE Slave Client does not execute Actions due to uninstalled or unconfigured Adapters, we have to know it.
** Check if DBEnv.sh can be removed.
** Check if CmdOtherSession framework can be removed.
** Adapt ShowWEACE{Master|Slave}Info.rb so they display information correctly.
** Implement uninstall (generic) function on WEACEInstall.rb.
** Ensure that Master Processes and Slave Actions respect the signature they should have.
** Replace "#!/usr/bin/env ruby" files with platform independent ones.
** Replace .sh creation with platform independent one.
** Implement dumpTerminal
